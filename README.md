# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide to be used as a learning tool for my bootcamp at UNCCH.  I wanted to use this project as a sandbox to learn more than just how to create a shell of a website, 
and so I tried to take extra steps throughout the process to make things my own instead of a copy and pasted project.  I learned a lot by going off of the beaten path, and think that I have learned enough to be comfortable starting a side project of my own before this bootcamp officially begins.  I want to take what I have learned here and create an interactive schedule website for myself to use to better my time management. The HTML I have learned will let me build the base site.  The CSS I have learned will help me make it flow and appealing to the eye.  The JavaScript I have learned will let me add the interaction, which will be crucial for planning and tracking blocks of time.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
